## Description

As part of [AI-READI](https://aireadi.org/), a data generation project supported by the NIH-funded Bridge2AI program, we are developing fairhub.io. This is a web platform for easily managing, curating, and sharing clinical and biomedical research data such that the data is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and ready for downstream AI-based analysis. For the duration of the project, we anticipate the platform to support the mangement, curation, and sharing of data generated by the AI-READI project where we expect to collect diabetes-related multimodal data from 4,000 study participant during 2022-2026 (more details are available on the project website [aireadi.org](https://aireadi.org/)). This repository contains the source code of fairhub.io along with instructions for using the source code as well as pointers to various documentation and resources related to the platform

## Getting started

### Prerequisites/Dependencies

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

#### Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
   1. Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
   2. Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.

### Installing

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

```sh
npm install
```

#### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

#### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

#### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

#### Run End-to-End Tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

```sh
npm run build
npm run test:e2e # or `npm run test:e2e:ci` for headless testing
```

#### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```
