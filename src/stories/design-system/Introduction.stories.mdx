# Introduction

We will be using Tailwind CSS for our design system. Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.

Almost all config options will be directly managed through the `tailwind.config.js` file. This file is where you will define your theme colors, spacing, font sizes, etc. You can also add custom CSS to this file if you need to override any of the default Tailwind styles.

To learn more about Tailwind, check out their documentation at https://tailwindcss.com.
