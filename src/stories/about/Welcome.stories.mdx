# Design System for FAIRhub.io

Here you can find our design system for FAIRhub.io. It is a living document that will be updated as we go along. If you have any questions, please contact us at [email protected] or [email protected].

## What is FAIRhub.io?

FAIRhub.io is the data management, curation, and sharing platform developed for AI-READI, a data generation project of the [NIH Bridge2AI program](https://commonfund.nih.gov/bridge2ai). It is intended to easily prepare and share FAIR and AI-ready medical research datasets.

## What is a design system?

A design system is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of applications. It is a way of working that allows teams to work efficiently and at scale. It also helps to ensure consistency and quality across all products.

## Why do we need a design system?

We need a design system to help us build a consistent and high-quality user experience across all of our products. It will help us to work more efficiently and at scale, and to ensure that we are building the right things in the right way.

## What is AI-READI?

AI-READI is one of the data generation projects of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded Bridge2AI Program. The AI-READI project seeks to create and share a flagship ethically-sourced dataset of type 2 diabetes. The data will be optimized for future artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) analysis that could provide critical insights and especially shine light on the salutogenic pathways from diabetes to return to health.
